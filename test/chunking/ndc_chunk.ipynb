       "'\\n\\nThailand\\'s national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions represent only 0.84% of global emissions\\nin 2012. The country\\'s share of cumulative emissions from 1990-2012 is 0.75%. In 2012, per\\ncapita GHG emissions is at 5.63 tCO e and emissions per GDP (US$ million) is 409.54 tCO e,\\n2 2\\nwhich is lower than world average. In terms of emission profile, the Second National\\nCommunication indicates that 67% of total GHG emissions in Thailand in 2000 is from the\\nenergy sector. In 2012, CAIT data indicates 73% share is from energy. Consequently,\\nThailand\\'s mitigation efforts have focused primarily on the energy, including transport sector.\\n\\nAt COP20 in Lima, Thailand pledged our pre-2020 contribution of 7-20% GHG emission\\nreduction by 2020 below business-as-usual (BAU) in the energy and transport sectors.\\n\\nAccording to a preliminary analysis, Thailand has already achieved 4% of GHG emission\\nreduction from the projected 2020 BAU and is well on track to achieving the 7% target pledged\\nas voluntary domestic efforts by 2020. Our INDC will continue such efforts with ambitious plans\\nin the relevant sectors while considering also our national circumstances and context, including:❑ Thailand has taken early actions in the field of energy and has very ambitious plans in\\nthe relevant sectors.\\n\\nEnergy security has long been an issue of concern over the course of Thailand\\'s development.\\n\\nIn the past, power generation in Thailand relied heavily on crude oil imports. To remedy this, the\\nGovernment initiated a shift to natural gas in the power generation sector as early as the 1980s.\\n\\nSuch effort has continued throughout the 1990s. And, in 2005 about 72% of electricity in\\nThailand was generated using natural gas, which is already a cleaner alternative to other types\\nof fossil fuels. These early actions imply that Thailand is left with less available choices and\\nfaced with higher marginal cost of further reducing GHG emission in the energy sector.\\n\\nDespite some limitations due to our early actions, the Ministry of Energy is taking a step forward\\nto balance three key aspects of energy planning for Thailand: security, economy and ecology,\\nalso taking into account the need to address climate change. Ambitious targets are defined in\\nthe Power Development Plan (PDP), the Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP) and the\\nEnergy Efficiency Plan (EEP). For example, the PDP sets a target to achieve a 20% share of\\npower generation from renewable sources in 2036. The AEDP aims to achieve a 30% share of\\nrenewable energy in the total final energy consumption in 2036. The EEP plans to reduce the\\ncountry’s energy intensity by 30% below the 2010 level in 2036.\\n\\nThe Environmentally Sustainable Transport System Plan also proposes ambitious actions to\\npromote road-to-rail modal shift for both freight and passenger transport, which include\\nextensions of mass rapid transit lines, construction of double-track railways and improvement of\\nbus transit in the Bangkok Metro areas. A vehicle tax scheme based on CO emission was also\\n2\\napproved and will become effective beginning 2016. In addition, just last year the Government\\nadopted the Waste Management Roadmap, aiming towards more efficient and sustainable\\nwaste management and promotion of power generation from waste-to-energy technologies. The\\nroadmap can contribute tremendous environmental benefits in terms of GHG emission and\\npollution reduction. Currently, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment is also\\nstudying the potential to reduce carbon emission in the forest sector through the REDD+\\nReadiness. We will continue to explore further opportunities and cooperation in this sector.\\n\\n❑ Major barriers to successful implementation include high costs and capacity\\nconstraints.\\n\\nIt is important to incorporate concerns that several of the proposed measures and actions in\\nthese ambitious plans are subject to very high investment and operating costs, particularly costs\\nof technologies and infrastructures which can become an important barrier to successful\\nimplementation of the plans. Some of the key barriers for the energy sector include, for\\ninstance, limitation of grid connection due to inadequate capacity of transmission lines, lack of\\nsupport by financial institutions for energy efficiency and renewable energy investments, lack of\\ndomestic technological and technical resources and negative public perception particularly\\nagainst waste-to-energy and biomass power plants. Several measures require a high level of\\ntechnical capacity and effective coordination across different sectoral agencies, whereas such\\ntechnical capacity and effective coordination in a developing country like Thailand is currently\\nlacking. For renewable energy development in particular, the International Energy Agency also\\ncited some of the above-mentioned barriers as common barriers for renewable energy\\ndeployment in developing countries. Domestically, Thailand has launched several support\\nmechanisms such as feed-in tariffs, tax incentives and access to investment grants and venture\\ncapital to promote renewable energy. However, to achieve ambitious and more rapid renewable\\nenergy deployment, incentives have to be created for technology developers to cooperate andshare technology knowledge to enable technology transfer on a larger scale. International\\nfinancial support mechanisms such as technical assistance and technology transfer funds for\\npurchasing intellectual property rights for a free distribution of clean energy technologies would\\nbe very valuable to accelerate diffusion of renewable energy technologies for developing\\ncountries1. Furthermore, efforts are needed to inform the public, through lessons-learned and\\nexperience sharing from other countries, as well as showcasing success stories from pilot or\\ndemonstration projects, for instance. It is therefore crucial that international cooperation through\\nthe UNFCCC focus on these cooperative attempts to unlock the potentials of developing\\ncountries in their contributions towards the global solutions to climate change by addressing\\nthese important identified barriers, making technological solutions more affordable for\\ndeveloping countries and strengthening the capacity of developing countries to implement these\\nsolutions more effectively and more sustainably. Successful implementation of these ambitious\\nmitigation plans in Thailand, in addition to our domestic efforts, will be subject to adequate and\\npredictable access to enhanced means of implementation agreed under the UNFCCC.\\n\\nAdaptation Efforts\\nThailand is a country located in a tropical Southeast Asian peninsula and has 2,420 kilometres\\nof coastline on the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea. According to the Fifth Assessment\\nReport by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Southeast Asia is one of the\\ntwo most vulnerable regions in the world to coastal flooding. In addition, this region is predicted\\nto face with increased annual mean precipitation and extreme precipitation. Geographically\\ntherefore, Thailand is a country highly vulnerable to adverse impacts of climate change, and is\\nranked as the eleventh country most affected by climate-related impacts from 1994–2013.\\n\\nThailand is also considered one of the sixteen countries in the \"extreme risk\" category that are\\nmost vulnerable to the future climate change impacts over the next thirty years. Statistically,\\nfrom 1955 to 2005, Thailand experienced an increase of 0.95°C for mean temperature, 0.86°C\\nfor maximum temperature and 1.45°C for minimum temperature. From 1955-2014, number of\\nrain days in Thailand has significantly decreased by 0.99 day per decade while daily rainfall\\nintensity increased. National projections indicate heavier rainfalls are expected in areas with\\nalready high precipitation level, such as the southern peninsula, whereas for the arid, inland\\nnortheastern region, precipitation level is expected to decline even further. As a result, severe\\nflooding and drought can be expected. Severe flooding in a similar magnitude to the 2011 flood\\nin Thailand could cost as much as US$40 billion to the economy, and led to an estimated 2.5%\\ndrop in global industrial production. The economic loss due to the recent drought can be\\nestimated as equivalent to 0.52% of the country’s GDP in 2015, with disproportionate impacts to\\nthe agricultural sector, and in particular to subsistent farmers .\\n\\nAdaptation is therefore top priority in Thailand\\'s national response to climate change. Thailand’s\\nadaptation efforts aim to enhance climate resilience through the guidance of the Philosophy of\\nSufficiency Economy, bestowed by His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Sufficiency Economy\\nstresses the middle path as an overriding principle for appropriate conduct by Thai people at all\\nlevels, from family to community to country. “Sufficiency” means moderation, reasonableness,\\nand the need of self-immunity for sufficient protection from impact arising from internal and\\nexternal changes. To achieve this, the application of knowledge with due consideration and\\nprudence is essential. In particular, great care is needed at every step in the utilization of\\n1 IEA (International Energy Agency) (2011), Renewable Energy. Policy Considerations for Deploying\\nRenewables, OECD/IEA, Paris.theories and methodologies for planning and implementation. In addition, a way of life based on\\npatience, perseverance, diligence, wisdom and prudence is indispensable to create balance\\nand be able to cope appropriately with critical challenges, arising from extensive and rapid\\nsocioeconomic, environmental, and cultural changes in the world.\\n\\nThailand’s prioritized adaptation efforts include:\\n• Promote and strengthen Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) practices to\\nachieve water security, effective water resource management to mitigate flood and\\ndrought\\n• Safeguard food security through the guidance of Sufficiency Economy Philosophy e.g.\\n\\nan application of the New Theory in agriculture and land management to promote\\nappropriate resource allocation and economic diversification at the household level and\\nsustainable management of community forests to promote food security at the\\ncommunity level, for instance\\n• Promote sustainable agriculture and Good Agricultural Practice (GAP)\\n• Increase capacity to manage climate-related health impacts - including through\\ndevelopment of health surveillance and early warning systems, systematic climate risk\\nassessment and effective disease prevention and response measures to climate change\\nrelated health consequences\\n• Increase national forest cover to 40% through local community participation, including in\\nparticular headwater and mangrove forests to enhance adaptive capacities of related\\necosystem\\n• Safeguard biodiversity and restore ecological integrity in protected areas and important\\nlandscapes from the adverse impacts of climate change, with the emphasis on\\nvulnerable ecosystems and red list species\\n• Develop participatory, integrated marine conservation and coastal rehabilitation plan to\\nprotect marine ecosystem and enhance climate proofing infrastructure to strengthen\\ncoastal protection against erosion\\n• Promote nature-based and sustainable tourism while enhancing better understanding on\\nrisk and vulnerability of the tourism sector, especially in hotspot areas\\n• Strengthen disaster risk reduction and reduce population’s vulnerability to climate risk\\nand extreme weather events through enhanced awareness, coordination and adaptive\\ncapacity of local communities, especially in the disaster risk-prone areas\\n• Strengthen climate modeling capacity while promoting collaboration among relevant\\nagencies\\n• Establish effective early warning system and enhance the adaptive capacity of national\\nagencies through multi-hazard risk assessment, systematic observations, integrative\\nresearch and development of database, model, and technology\\n• Build regional climate resilience by serving as a knowledge hub to foster regional\\ncooperation and exchange experiences on adaptation\\nThese shortlisted adaptation efforts are essential to build and enhance Thailand’s resilience to\\nclimate impacts. As guided by the Philosophy of Sufficiency Economy, knowledge building and\\ncareful planning is fundamental to the efforts to raise adaptive capacity of stakeholders at\\ndifferent levels. This requires cautious application of local wisdoms in combination with modern\\nknowledge, techniques and technologies. Effective implementation of such adaptation efforts\\ntherefore requires substantive and ongoing capacity building of relevant stakeholders to be able\\nto raise the necessary adaptive capacity to respond successfully to climate variability and\\nchange. Adequate financial resources and appropriate technology development and transfer areextremely important and can lead to improved outcomes and increased coping, thus enhancing\\nadaptive capacity under various conditions of climate change. Thailand’s Technology Needs\\nAssessment (TNA) report formulated in 2012 has identified three highly impacted sectors in\\nurgent need of adaptation technologies. These are:\\n(1) Agriculture, in need of forecasting and early warning system technologies, crop improvement\\ntechnologies, and precision farming technologies\\n(2) Water Resource Management, in need of networking (via pipes and canals) and\\nmanagement of infrastructures (including zoning), seasonal climate prediction, and sensor web\\nusing observation and/or modeling data\\n(3) Modeling, in need of an integrated national data center, national data transfer/management\\nprocess and the advanced research, weather research and forecasting (WRF - ARW) model,\\nand an integrated model to address the need of agricultural sector and water resource\\nmanagement sector\\nDuring 2009-2011, budget for adaptation actions in Thailand accounted for 68% of the total\\nbudget allocated to climate change.

Effective implementation of such adaptation efforts\\ntherefore requires substantive and ongoing capacity building of relevant stakeholders to be able\\nto raise the necessary adaptive capacity to respond successfully to climate variability and\\nchange. Adequate financial resources and appropriate technology development and transfer areextremely important and can lead to improved outcomes and increased coping, thus enhancing\\nadaptive capacity under various conditions of climate change. Thailand’s Technology Needs\\nAssessment (TNA) report formulated in 2012 has identified three highly impacted sectors in\\nurgent need of adaptation technologies. These are:\\n(1) Agriculture, in need of forecasting and early warning system technologies, crop improvement\\ntechnologies, and precision farming technologies\\n(2) Water Resource Management, in need of networking (via pipes and canals) and\\nmanagement of infrastructures (including zoning), seasonal climate prediction, and sensor web\\nusing observation and/or modeling data\\n(3) Modeling, in need of an integrated national data center, national data transfer/management\\nprocess and the advanced research, weather research and forecasting (WRF - ARW) model,\\nand an integrated model to address the need of agricultural sector and water resource\\nmanagement sector\\nDuring 2009-2011, budget for adaptation actions in Thailand accounted for 68% of the total\\nbudget allocated to climate change. As climate change continues, the need for adaptation\\nfinance is expected to substantially increase in the future, consequently creating extra burden\\non an already scarce government fiscal budget of many developing countries including\\nThailand. To ensure that adaptation actions can be effectively enhanced to address the distress\\nexperienced in highly vulnerable developing countries, it will be necessary to secure adequate\\nmeans of implementation including finance, technology development and transfer and capacity\\nbuilding for adaptation in the new global agreement under the UNFCCC. Adaptation\\nundertakings of developing countries do not provide benefits only at the local and national\\nscales, but also contribute to the resilience of global food production system, enable ecosystem\\nand biodiversity protection, enhance the livelihood particularly of low-income population and\\ncontribute to the achievement of the global millennium and sustainable development goals, as\\nwell as the objective of the UNFCCC set forth in its Article 2.',\n",
       " 'Finally, recognizing that long-term and continuous effort is required to address climate change,\\nThailand has formulated the National Strategic Plan on Climate Change B.E. 2551-2555 (2008-\\n2012) and the Climate Change Master Plan B.E. 2558-2593 (2015-2050), providing a\\ncontinuous framework for measures and actions in the long-term. The Climate Change Master\\nPlan has laid out a vision to achieve climate-resilient and low-carbon growth in line with\\nsustainable development path by 2050, and has recently been approved by the Cabinet.',\n",

Several measures require a high level of\\ntechnical capacity and effective coordination across different sectoral agencies, whereas such\\ntechnical capacity and effective coordination in a developing country like Thailand is currently\\nlacking. For renewable energy development in particular, the International Energy Agency also\\ncited some of the above-mentioned barriers as common barriers for renewable energy\\ndeployment in developing countries. Domestically, Thailand has launched several support\\nmechanisms such as feed-in tariffs, tax incentives and access to investment grants and venture\\ncapital to promote renewable energy. However, to achieve ambitious and more rapid renewable\\nenergy deployment, incentives have to be created for technology developers to cooperate andshare technology knowledge to enable technology transfer on a larger scale. International\\nfinancial support mechanisms such as technical assistance and technology transfer funds for\\npurchasing intellectual property rights for a free distribution of clean energy technologies would\\nbe very valuable to accelerate diffusion of renewable energy technologies for developing\\ncountries1. Furthermore, efforts are needed to inform the public, through lessons-learned and\\nexperience sharing from other countries, as well as showcasing success stories from pilot or\\ndemonstration projects, for instance. It is therefore crucial that international cooperation through\\nthe UNFCCC focus on these cooperative attempts to unlock the potentials of developing\\ncountries in their contributions towards the global solutions to climate change by addressing\\nthese important identified barriers, making technological solutions more affordable for\\ndeveloping countries and strengthening the capacity of developing countries to implement these\\nsolutions more effectively and more sustainably.
